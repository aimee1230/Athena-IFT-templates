In Apache web server installations, the .htaccess file may enable server side includes in specific locations. In those cases, the .htaccess file lives inside the directory where SSI is enabled, and is theoretically fetchable from the web server.

Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL., Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL.

Determining whether the server supports SSI does not require special tools, and nor does injecting directives that get executed.

There needs to be a way to supply input to that functionality from the internet zone and that original input needs to be used later on a page from a local zone.\nStep 2 \nPhase: Experiment \nTechniques: Finding weaknesses in functionality used by both privileged and unprivileged users.\nDescription: [Find the insertion point for the payload] The attacker first needs to find some system functionality or possibly another weakness in the system (e.g. susceptibility to cross site scripting) that would provide the attacker with a mechanism to deliver the payload (i.e. the code to be executed) to the user. The location from which this code is executed in the user's browser needs to be within the local machine zone.\nStep 3 \nPhase: Exploit \nTechniques: The attacker makes it as likely as possible that the vulnerable functionality into which they have injected the payload has a high likelihood of being used by the victim., Leverage cross-site scripting vulnerability to inject payload.\nDescription: [Craft and inject the payload] Develop the payload to be executed in the higher privileged zone in the user's browser. Inject the payload and attempt to lure the victim (if possible) into executing the functionality which unleashes the payload.\nRelated weaknesses:CWE-250, CWE-638, CWE-285, CWE-116, CWE-20"}
