The HttpOnly flag directs compatible browsers to prevent client-side script from accessing cookies. Including the HttpOnly flag in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header helps mitigate the risk associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where an attacker's script code might attempt to read the contents of a cookie and exfiltrate information obtained. When set, browsers that support the flag will not reveal the contents of the cookie to a third party via client-side script executed via XSS."}

This data can be leveraged for a variety of purposes including saving information entered into form fields, recording user activity, and for authentication purposes. Cookies used to save or record information generated by the user are accessed and modified by script code embedded in a web page. While cookies used for authentication are created by the website's server and sent to the user to be attached to future requests. These authentication cookies are often not meant to be accessed by the web page sent to the user, and are instead just supposed to be attached to future requests to verify authentication details. In essence, The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag."}

If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can alter the intended control flow by redirecting a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator. This primarily impacts integrity, confidentiality, availability through execute unauthorized code or commands.\n2. Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash.

The most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing. The attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program. Alternately, the attacker can supply the address of an important call, for instance the POSIX system() call, leaving arguments to the call on the stack. This is often called a return into libc exploit, since the attacker generally forces the program to jump at return time into an interesting routine in the C standard library (libc). Other important data commonly on the stack include the stack pointer and frame pointer, two values that indicate offsets for computing memory addresses. Modifying those values can often be leveraged into a \"write-what-where\" condition.

(Requirements) A non-SQL style database which is not subject to this flaw may be chosen.\n2. (Architecture and Design) Follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. Users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data.\n3. (Architecture and Design) For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\n4. (Implementation) Implement SQL strings using prepared statements that bind variables. Prepared statements that do not bind variables can be vulnerable to attack.\n5. (Implementation) Use vigorous allowlist style checking on any user input that may be used in a SQL command. Rather than escape meta-characters, it is safest to disallow them entirely. Reason: Later use of data that have been entered in the database may neglect to escape meta-characters before use. Narrowly define the set of safe characters based on the expected value of the parameter in the request."}

Clearly, write-what-where conditions can be used to write data to areas of memory outside the scope of a policy. Also, they almost invariably can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator. This primarily impacts integrity, confidentiality, availability, access control through modify memory.\n2. Many memory accesses can lead to program termination, such as when writing to addresses that are invalid for the current process. This primarily impacts integrity, availability through dos: crash, exit, or restart.\n3.

Hardware logic operates on data stored in registers local to the hardware block. Most hardware IPs, including cryptographic accelerators, rely on registers to buffer I/O, store intermediate values, and interface with software. The result of this is that sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, can exist in locations not transparent to the user of the hardware logic. When a different entity obtains access to the IP due to a change in operating mode or conditions, the new entity can extract information belonging to the previous user if no mechanisms are in place to clear register contents. It is important to clear information stored in the hardware if a physical attack on the product is detected, or if the user of the hardware block changes.

{"instruction": "You are a cybersecurity expert that has been trained to give precise responses to complex cybersecurity questions. You work in a SOC protecting data for enterprise customers helping to protect their digital assets.", "input": "How can Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (CWE-1240) be detected and prevented?", "output": "Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation can be detected using the following methods:\n1. Architecture or Design Review: Review requirements, documentation, and product design to ensure that primitives are consistent with the strongest-available recommendations from trusted parties. If the product appears to be using custom or proprietary implementations that have not had sufficient public review and approval, then this is a significant concern.\n2. Manual Analysis: Analyze the product to ensure that implementations for each primitive do not contain any known vulnerabilities and are not using any known-weak algorithms, including MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, etc.\n3. Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation: For hardware, during the implementation (pre-Silicon / post-Silicon) phase, dynamic tests should be done to ensure that outputs from cryptographic routines are indeed working properly, such as test vectors provided by NIST [REF-1236].\n4. Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation: It needs to be determined if the output of a cryptographic primitive is lacking entropy, which is one clear sign that something went wrong with the crypto implementation. There exist many methods of measuring the entropy of a bytestream, from sophisticated ones (like calculating Shannon's entropy of a sequence of characters) to crude ones (by compressing it and comparing the size of the original bytestream vs. the compressed - a truly random byte stream should not be compressible and hence the uncompressed and compressed bytestreams should be nearly identical in size).\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Requirements) Require compliance with the strongest-available recommendations from trusted parties, and require that compliance must be kept up-to-date, since recommendations evolve over time. For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-3 certification, which supersedes FIPS 140-2 [REF-1192] [REF-267].\n2. (Architecture and Design) Ensure that the architecture/design uses the strongest-available primitives and algorithms from trusted parties. For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-3 certification, which supersedes FIPS 140-2 [REF-1192] [REF-267].\n3. (Architecture and Design) Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis. If the algorithm may be compromised when attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.\n4. (Architecture and Design) Try not to use cryptographic algorithms in novel ways or with new modes of operation even when you \"know\" it is secure. For example, using SHA-2 chaining to create a 1-time pad for encryption might sound like a good idea, but one should not do this.\n5. (Architecture and Design) Ensure that the design can replace one cryptographic primitive or algorithm with another in the next generation (\"cryptographic agility\"). Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. This is especially important for hardware, which can be more difficult to upgrade quickly than software; design the hardware at a replaceable block level.\n6. (Architecture and Design) Do not use outdated or non-compliant cryptography algorithms. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong [REF-267].\n7. (Architecture and Design) Do not use a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) or other legacy methods as a substitute for an accepted and standard Random Number Generator.\n8. (Architecture and Design) Do not use a checksum as a substitute for a cryptographically generated hash.\n9. (Architecture and Design) Use a vetted cryptographic library or framework. Industry-standard implementations will save development time and are more likely to avoid errors that can occur during implementation of cryptographic algorithms. However, the library/framework could be used incorrectly during implementation.\n10. (Architecture and Design) When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for the prevention of common attacks.\n11. (Architecture and Design) Do not store keys in areas accessible to untrusted agents. Carefully manage and protect the cryptographic keys (see CWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography algorithm is irrelevant."}

Manual Analysis: \n2. Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation: During the implementation phase where actual hardware is available, specialized hardware tools and apparatus such as ChipWhisperer may be used to check if the platform is indeed susceptible to voltage and clock glitching attacks.\n3. Architecture or Design Review: Review if the protections against glitching merely transfer the attack target. For example, suppose a critical authentication routine that an attacker would want to bypass is given the protection of modifying certain artifacts from within that specific routine (so that if the routine is bypassed, one can examine the artifacts and figure out that an attack must have happened). However, if the attacker has the ability to bypass the critical authentication routine, they might also have the ability to bypass the other protection routine that checks the artifacts. Basically, depending on these kind of protections is akin to resorting to \"Security by Obscurity\".\n4. Architecture or Design Review: Many SoCs come equipped with a built-in Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) that can control the voltage and clocks via software alone. However, there have been demonstrated attacks (like Plundervolt and CLKSCREW) that target this DVFS [REF-1081] [REF-1082]. During the design and implementation phases, one needs to check if the interface to this power management feature is available from unprivileged SW (CWE-1256), which would make the attack very easy.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1.

Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.\n2. Automated Static Analysis: Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1.

These actions may be one of the directives: 'read', 'write', 'program', 'reset', 'fetch', 'compute', etc. Security Tokens are assigned to every agent in the System that is capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Multiple Security Tokens may be assigned to an agent and may be unique based on the agent's trust level or allowed privileges.

Manual Analysis: This is applicable in the Architecture phase before implementation started. Make sure access policy is specified for the entire memory map. Manual analysis may not ensure the implementation is correct.\n2. Manual Analysis: Registers controlling hardware should have access control implemented. This access control may be checked manually for correct implementation. Items to check consist of how are trusted parties set, how are trusted parties verified, how are accesses verified, etc. Effectiveness of a manual analysis will vary depending upon how complicated the interface is constructed.\n3. Simulation / Emulation: Functional simulation is applicable during the Implementation Phase. Testcases must be created and executed for memory mapped registers to verify adherence to the access control policy. This method can be effective, since functional verification needs to be performed on the design, and verification for this weakness will be included. There can be difficulty covering the entire memory space during the test.\n4. Formal Verification: Formal verification is applicable during the Implementation phase. Assertions need to be created in order to capture illegal register access scenarios and prove that they cannot occur. Formal methods are exhaustive and can be very effective, but creating the cases for large designs may be complex and difficult.\n5. Automated Analysis: Information flow tracking can be applicable during the Implementation phase. Security sensitive data (assets) - for example, as stored in registers - is automatically tracked over time through the design to verify the data doesn't reach illegal destinations that violate the access policies for the memory map. This method can be very effective when used together with simulation and emulation, since detecting violations doesn't rely on specific scenarios or data values. This method does rely on simulation and emulation, so testcases must exist in order to use this method.\n6. Architecture or Design Review: Manual documentation review of the system memory map, register specification, and permissions associated with accessing security-relevant functionality exposed via memory-mapped registers.\n7. Fuzzing: Perform penetration testing (either manual or semi-automated with fuzzing) to verify that access control mechanisms such as the memory protection units or on-chip bus firewall settings adequately protect critical hardware registers from software access.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) Design proper policies for hardware register access from software.\n2.

(Implementation) Set the SameSite attribute of a sensitive cookie to 'Lax' or 'Strict'. This instructs the browser to apply this cookie only to same-domain requests, which provides a good Defense in Depth against CSRF attacks. When the 'Lax' value is in use, cookies are also sent for top-level cross-domain navigation via HTTP GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE methods, but not for other HTTP methods that are more like to cause side-effects of state mutation."}

Use of an index that is outside the bounds of an array will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory and perhaps instructions, leading to a crash, if the values are outside of the valid memory area. This primarily impacts integrity, availability through dos: crash, exit, or restart.\n2. If the memory corrupted is data, rather than instructions, the system will continue to function with improper values. This primarily impacts integrity through modify memory.\n3. Use of an index that is outside the bounds of an array can also trigger out-of-bounds read or write operations, or operations on the wrong objects; i.e., \"buffer overflows\" are not always the result. This may result in the exposure or modification of sensitive data. This primarily impacts confidentiality, integrity through modify memory.\n4. If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow and possibly without the use of large inputs if a precise index can be controlled. This primarily impacts integrity, confidentiality, availability through execute unauthorized code or commands.\n5. A single fault could allow either an overflow (CWE-788) or underflow (CWE-786) of the array index. What happens next will depend on the type of operation being performed out of bounds, but can expose sensitive information, cause a system crash, or possibly lead to arbitrary code execution.

Automated Static Analysis: \n2. Automated Dynamic Analysis: This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.\n3. Black Box: Black box methods might not get the needed code coverage within limited time constraints, and a dynamic test might not produce any noticeable side effects even if it is successful.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).\n2. (Architecture and Design) \n3. (Requirements) \n4. (Operation) \n5. (Operation) \n6. (Implementation) \n7. (Implementation) Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.\n8. (Architecture and Design) Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\n9. (Architecture and Design) "}

The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.\n3.

Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode: \n7. Manual Static Analysis - Source Code: \n8. Automated Static Analysis - Source Code: \n9. Architecture or Design Review: \nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Implementation) When allocating a buffer for the purpose of transforming, converting, or encoding an input, allocate enough memory to handle the largest possible encoding. For example, in a routine that converts \"&\" characters to \"&amp;\" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.\n2. (Implementation) \n3. (Implementation) Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.\n4. (Architecture and Design) For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\n5. (Implementation) When processing structured incoming data containing a size field followed by raw data, identify and resolve any inconsistencies between the size field and the actual size of the data (CWE-130).\n6. (Implementation) When allocating memory that uses sentinels to mark the end of a data structure - such as NUL bytes in strings - make sure you also include the sentinel in your calculation of the total amount of memory that must be allocated.\n7. (Implementation) Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.\n8. (Implementation) Use sizeof() on the appropriate data type to avoid CWE-467.\n9. (Implementation) Use the appropriate type for the desired action. For example, in C/C++, only use unsigned types for values that could never be negative, such as height, width, or other numbers related to quantity. This will simplify validation and will reduce surprises related to unexpected casting.\n10. (Architecture and Design) \n11. (Operation) \n12. (Operation) \n13. (Operation) \n14. (Implementation) Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.\n15. (Architecture and Design) Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\n16. (Architecture and Design) "}

Automated Static Analysis: This weakness can be found using automated static analysis once a developer has indicated which code paths are critical to protect.\n2. Simulation / Emulation: This weakness can be found using automated dynamic analysis. Both emulation of a CPU with instruction skips, as well as RTL simulation of a CPU IP, can indicate parts of the code that are sensitive to faults due to instruction skips.\n3. Manual Analysis: This weakness can be found using manual (static) analysis. The analyst has security objectives that are matched against the high-level code. This method is less precise than emulation, especially if the analysis is done at the higher level language rather than at assembly level.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) Design strategies for ensuring safe failure if\n                        inputs, such as Vcc, are modified out of acceptable\n                        ranges.\n2. (Architecture and Design) Design strategies for ensuring safe behavior if\n                        instructions attempt to be skipped.\n3. (Architecture and Design) Identify mission critical secrets that should\n                          be wiped if faulting is detected, and design a\n                          mechanism to do the deletion.\n4. (Implementation) Add redundancy by performing an operation\n                          multiple times, either in space or time, and perform\n                          majority voting. Additionally, make conditional\n                          instruction timing unpredictable.\n5. (Implementation) Use redundant operations or canaries to\n                          detect and respond to faults.\n6. (Implementation) Ensure that fault mitigations are strong enough\n                        in practice. For example, a low power detection\n                        mechanism that takes 50 clock cycles to trigger at lower\n                        voltages may be an insufficient security mechanism if\n                        the instruction counter has already progressed with no\n                        other CPU activity occurring."}

The programmer can also use the concept of an Unum real. The memory and CPU tradeoffs of this change must be examined. Since floating point reals are used in many products and many locations, they are implemented in hardware and most format changes will cause the calculations to be moved into software resulting in slower products."}

(Implementation) Developers should anticipate that special elements (e.g. delimiters, symbols) will be injected into input vectors of their product. One defense is to create an allowlist (e.g. a regular expression) that defines valid input according to the requirements specifications. Strictly filter any input that does not match against the allowlist. Properly encode your output, and quote any elements that have special meaning to the component with which you are communicating.\n2. (Implementation) \n3. (Implementation) Use and specify an appropriate output encoding to ensure that the special elements are well-defined. A normal byte sequence in one encoding could be a special element in another.\n4. (Implementation) Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.\n5. (Implementation) While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88)."}

(Implementation) While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).\n4. (Implementation) Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked."}

Automated Analysis: For software, use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, which automatically analyze products to identify third-party dependencies. Often, SCA tools can be used to link with known vulnerabilities in the dependencies that they detect. There are commercial and open-source alternatives, such as OWASP Dependency-Check [REF-1312]. Many languages or frameworks have package managers with similar capabilities, such as npm audit for JavaScript, pip-audit for Python, govulncheck for Go, and many others. Dynamic methods can detect loading of third-party components.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Requirements) In some industries such as healthcare [REF-1320] [REF-1322] or technologies such as the cloud [REF-1321], it might be unclear about who is responsible for applying patches for third-party vulnerabilities: the vendor, the operator/customer, or a separate service. Clarifying roles and responsibilities can be important to minimize confusion or unnecessary delay when third-party vulnerabilities are disclosed.\n2. (Requirements) Require a Bill of Materials for all components and sub-components of the product. For software, require a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) [REF-1247] [REF-1311].\n3. (Architecture and Design) Maintain a Bill of Materials for all components and sub-components of the product. For software, maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). According to [REF-1247], \"An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies, information about those components, and their hierarchical relationships.\"\n4. (Operation) Actively monitor when a third-party component vendor announces vulnerability patches; fix the third-party component as soon as possible; and make it easy for operators/customers to obtain and apply the patch.\n5. (Operation) Continuously monitor changes in each of the product's components, especially when the changes indicate new vulnerabilities, end-of-life (EOL) plans, etc."}

You work in a SOC protecting data for enterprise customers helping to protect their digital assets.", "input": "How can Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution (CWE-1420) be detected and prevented?", "output": "Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution can be detected using the following methods:\n1. Manual Analysis: This weakness can be detected in hardware by manually inspecting processor specifications. Features that exhibit this weakness may include microarchitectural predictors, access control checks that occur out-of-order, or any other features that can allow operations to execute without committing to architectural state. Academic researchers have demonstrated that new hardware weaknesses can be discovered by exhaustively analyzing a processor's machine clear (or nuke) conditions ([REF-1427]).\n2. Fuzzing: Academic researchers have demonstrated that this weakness can be detected in hardware using software fuzzing tools that treat the underlying hardware as a black box ([REF-1428]).\n3. Fuzzing: Academic researchers have demonstrated that this weakness can be detected in software using software fuzzing tools ([REF-1429]).\n4. Automated Static Analysis: A variety of automated static analysis tools can identify\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpotentially exploitable code sequences in software. These tools may\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperform the analysis on source code, on binary code, or on an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintermediate code representation (for example, during compilation).\n5. Automated Analysis: Software vendors can release tools that detect presence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknown weaknesses on a processor. For example, some of these tools can\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattempt to transiently execute a vulnerable code sequence and detect\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhether code successfully leaks data in a manner consistent with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweakness under test. Alternatively, some hardware vendors provide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenumeration for the presence of a weakness (or lack of a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweakness). These enumeration bits can be checked and reported by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem software. For example, Linux supports these checks for many\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcommodity processors: \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep bugs | head -n 1 \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t bugs : cpu_meltdown spectre_v1 spectre_v2 spec_store_bypass l1tf mds swapgs taa itlb_multihit srbds mmio_stale_data retbleed\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) The hardware designer can attempt to prevent transient execution from causing observable discrepancies in specific covert channels.\n2. (Requirements) Processor designers may expose instructions or other architectural features that allow software to mitigate the effects of transient execution, but without disabling predictors. These features may also help to limit opportunities for data exposure.\n3. (Requirements) Processor designers may expose registers (for example, control registers or model-specific registers) that allow privileged and/or user software to disable specific predictors or other hardware features that can cause confidential data to be exposed during transient execution.\n4. (Requirements) Processor designers, system software vendors, or other agents may choose to restrict the ability of unprivileged software to access to high-resolution timers that are commonly used to monitor covert channels.\n5. (Build and Compilation) Isolate sandboxes or managed runtimes in separate address spaces (separate processes). For examples, see [REF-1421].\n6. (Build and Compilation) Include serialization instructions (for example, LFENCE) that prevent processor events or mis-predictions prior to the serialization instruction from causing transient execution after the serialization instruction. For some weaknesses, a serialization instruction can also prevent a processor event or a mis-prediction from occurring after the serialization instruction (for example, CVE-2018-3639 can allow a processor to predict that a load will not depend on an older store; a serialization instruction between the store and the load may allow the store to update memory and prevent the prediction from happening at all).\n7. (Build and Compilation) Use control-flow integrity (CFI) techniques to constrain the behavior of instructions that redirect the instruction pointer, such as indirect branch instructions.\n8. (Build and Compilation) If the weakness is exposed by a single instruction (or a small set of instructions), then the compiler (or JIT, etc.) can be configured to prevent the affected instruction(s) from being generated, and instead generate an alternate sequence of instructions that is not affected by the weakness. One prominent example of this mitigation is retpoline ([REF-1414]).\n9. (Build and Compilation) Use software techniques that can mitigate the consequences of transient execution. For example, address masking can be used in some circumstances to prevent out-of-bounds transient reads.\n10. (Build and Compilation) Use software techniques (including the use of serialization instructions) that are intended to reduce the number of instructions that can be executed transiently after a processor event or misprediction.\n11. (Documentation) If a hardware feature can allow incorrect operations (or correct operations with incorrect data) to execute transiently, the hardware designer may opt to disclose this behavior in architecture documentation. This documentation can inform users about potential consequences and effective mitigations."}

Automated Analysis: This weakness can be detected in hardware by employing static\n\t\t\t\t\tor dynamic taint analysis methods [REF-1401]. These methods can label\n\t\t\t\t\teach predictor entry (or prediction history, etc.) according to the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocessor context that created it. Taint analysis or information flow\n\t\t\t\t\tanalysis can then be applied to detect when predictor state created in\n\t\t\t\t\tone context can influence predictions made in another context.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) The hardware designer can attempt to prevent transient\n\t\t\t\t\texecution from causing observable discrepancies in specific covert\n\t\t\t\t\tchannels.\n2. (Architecture and Design) Hardware designers may choose to use microarchitectural\n\t\t\t\t\tbits to tag predictor entries. For example, each predictor entry may\n\t\t\t\t\tbe tagged with a kernel-mode bit which, when set, indicates that the\n\t\t\t\t\tpredictor entry was created in kernel mode. The processor can use this\n\t\t\t\t\tbit to enforce that predictions in the current mode must have been\n\t\t\t\t\ttrained in the current mode. This can prevent malicious cross-mode\n\t\t\t\t\ttraining, such as when user-mode software attempts to create predictor\n\t\t\t\t\tentries that influence transient execution in the kernel. Predictor\n\t\t\t\t\tentry tags can also be used to associate each predictor entry with the\n\t\t\t\t\tSMT thread that created it, and thus the processor can enforce that\n\t\t\t\t\teach predictor entry can only be used by the SMT thread that created\n\t\t\t\t\tit. This can prevent an SMT thread from using predictor entries\n\t\t\t\t\tcrafted by a malicious sibling SMT thread.\n3. (Architecture and Design) Hardware designers may choose to sanitize\n\t\t\t\t\tmicroarchitectural predictor state (for example, branch prediction\n\t\t\t\t\thistory) when the processor transitions to a different context, for\n\t\t\t\t\texample, whenever a system call is invoked. Alternatively, the\n\t\t\t\t\thardware may expose instruction(s) that allow software to sanitize\n\t\t\t\t\tpredictor state according to the user's threat model. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis can allow operating system software to sanitize predictor state\n\t\t\t\t\twhen performing a context switch from one process to another.\n4. (Implementation) System software can mitigate this weakness by invoking\n\t\t\t\t\tpredictor-state-sanitizing operations (for example, the indirect\n\t\t\t\t\tbranch prediction barrier on Intel x86) when switching from one\n\t\t\t\t\tcontext to another, according to the hardware vendor's\n\t\t\t\t\trecommendations.\n5. (Build and Compilation) If the weakness is exposed by a single instruction (or a\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall set of instructions), then the compiler (or JIT, etc.) can be\n\t\t\t\t\tconfigured to prevent the affected instruction(s) from being\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerated. One prominent example of this mitigation is retpoline\n\t\t\t\t\t([REF-1414]).\n6. (Build and Compilation) Use control-flow integrity (CFI) techniques to constrain\n\t\t\t\t\tthe behavior of instructions that redirect the instruction pointer,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as indirect branch instructions.\n7. (Build and Compilation) Use software techniques (including the use of\n\t\t\t\t\tserialization instructions) that are intended to reduce the number of\n\t\t\t\t\tinstructions that can be executed transiently after a processor event\n\t\t\t\t\tor misprediction.\n8. (System Configuration) Some systems may allow the user to disable predictor\n\t\t\t\t\tsharing. For example, this could be a BIOS configuration, or a\n\t\t\t\t\tmodel-specific register (MSR) that can be configured by the operating\n\t\t\t\t\tsystem or virtual machine monitor.\n9. (Patching and Maintenance) The hardware vendor may provide a patch to, for example,\n\t\t\t\t\tsanitize predictor state when the processor transitions to a different\n\t\t\t\t\tcontext, or to prevent predictor entries from being shared across SMT\n\t\t\t\t\tthreads.

Automated Static Analysis - Source Code: Automated static analysis can find some instances of this\n\t\t\t    weakness by analyzing source register-transfer level (RTL) code\n\t\t\t    without having to simulate it or analyze it with a formal verification\n\t\t\t    engine. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and\n\t\t\t    control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that\n\t\t\t    connect \"sources\" (signals with intermediate cryptographic\n\t\t\t    state/results) with \"sinks\" (hardware module outputs and other signals\n\t\t\t    outside of trusted cryptographic zone) without any control flow.\n2. Simulation / Emulation: Simulation/emulation based analysis can find some instances of\n\t\t\t    this weakness by simulating source register-transfer level (RTL) code\n\t\t\t    along with a set of assertions that incorporate the simulated values\n\t\t\t    of relevant design signals. Typically, these assertions will capture\n\t\t\t    desired or undesired behavior. Analysis can be improved by using\n\t\t\t    simulation-based information flow tracking (IFT) to more precisely\n\t\t\t    detect unexpected results.\n3. Formal Verification: Formal verification can find some instances of this weakness by\n\t\t\t    exhaustively analyzing whether a given assertion holds true for a\n\t\t\t    given hardware design specified in register-transfer level (RTL)\n\t\t\t    code. Typically, these assertions will capture desired or undesired\n\t\t\t    behavior. For this weakness, an assertion should check for undesired\n\t\t\t    behavior in which one output is a signal that captures when a\n\t\t\t    cryptographic algorithm has completely finished; another output is a\n\t\t\t    signal with intermediate cryptographic state/results; and there is an\n\t\t\t    assignment to a hardware module output or other signal outside of a\n\t\t\t    trusted cryptographic zone. \n\t\t\t     Alternatively, when using a formal IFT verification, the same\n\t\t\t    undesired behavior can be detected by checking if computation results\n\t\t\t    can ever leak to an output when the cryptographic result is not\n\t\t\t    copmlete.\n4. Manual Analysis: Manual analysis can find some instances of this weakness by\n\t\t\t    manually reviewing relevant lines of source register-transfer level\n\t\t\t    (RTL) code to detect potentially-vulnerable patterns. Typically, the\n\t\t\t    reviewer will trace the sequence of assignments that connect \"sources\"\n\t\t\t    (signals with intermediate cryptographic state/results) with \"sinks\"\n\t\t\t    (hardware module outputs and other signals outside of trusted\n\t\t\t    cryptographic zone). If this sequence of assignments is missing\n\t\t\t    adequate control flow, then the weakness is likely to exist.\nTo prevent it, apply the following mitigations: \n1. (Architecture and Design) Designers/developers\n\t\t\t    should add or modify existing control flow\n\t\t\t    logic along any data flow paths that\n\t\t\t    connect \"sources\" (signals with\n\t\t\t    intermediate cryptographic state/results)\n\t\t\t    with \"sinks\" (hardware module outputs and\n\t\t\t    other signals outside of trusted\n\t\t\t    cryptographic zone). The control flow\n\t\t\t    logic should only allow cryptographic\n\t\t\t    results to be driven to \"sinks\" when\n\t\t\t    appropriate conditions are satisfied\n\t\t\t    (typically when the final result for a\n\t\t\t    cryptographic operation has been\n\t\t\t    generated). When the appropriate\n\t\t\t    conditions are not satisfied (i.e., before\n\t\t\t    or during a cryptographic operation), the\n\t\t\t    control flow logic should drive a safe\n\t\t\t    default value to\n\t\t\t    \"sinks\".\n2. (Implementation) Designers/developers\n\t\t\t    should add or modify existing control flow\n\t\t\t    logic along any data flow paths that\n\t\t\t    connect \"sources\" (signals with\n\t\t\t    intermediate cryptographic state/results)\n\t\t\t    with \"sinks\" (hardware module outputs and\n\t\t\t    other signals outside of trusted\n\t\t\t    cryptographic zone). The control flow\n\t\t\t    logic should only allow cryptographic\n\t\t\t    results to be driven to \"sinks\" when\n\t\t\t    appropriate conditions are satisfied\n\t\t\t    (typically when the final result for a\n\t\t\t    cryptographic operation has been\n\t\t\t    generated). When the appropriate\n\t\t\t    conditions are not satisfied (i.e., before\n\t\t\t    or during a cryptographic operation), the\n\t\t\t    control flow logic should drive a safe\n\t\t\t    default value to\n\t\t\t    \"sinks\"."}
