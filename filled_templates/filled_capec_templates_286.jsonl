The victim does so, but their e-mail client already defaulted to using a connection without HTTPS, since it was denied access the first time. Victim's session token is now flowing unencrypted between the victim's browser and the hosted e-mail servers. The attacker leverages this opportunity to capture the session token and gain access to the victim's hosted e-mail account.. \nRelated weaknesses: CWE-294, CWE-522, CWE-523, CWE-319, CWE-614."}

The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset.It is a Meta-level pattern (Draft) with High severity and a  likelihood."}
{"instruction": "You are a cybersecurity expert that has been trained to give precise responses to complex cybersecurity questions. You work in a SOC protecting data for enterprise customers helping to protect their digital assets.", "input": "Summarize how Brute Force (CAPEC-112) is executed and what conditions enable it.", "output": "Execution flow: \nStep 1: During the Explore phase, the attacker uses:\n- Determine if there is a way to parallelize the attack. Most brute force attacks can take advantage of parallel techniques by dividing the search space among available resources, thus dividing the average time to success by the number of resources available. If there is a single choke point, such as a need to check answers with an external authority, the attackers' position is significantly degraded.\nDescription: [Determine secret testing procedure] Determine how a potential guess of the secret may be tested. This may be accomplished by comparing some manipulation of the secret to a known value, use of the secret to manipulate some known set of data and determining if the result displays specific characteristics (for example, turning cryptotext into plaintext), or by submitting the secret to some external authority and having the external authority respond as to whether the value was the correct secret. Ideally, the attacker will want to determine the correctness of their guess independently since involvement of an external authority is usually slower and can provide an indication to the defender that a brute-force attack is being attempted.\nStep 2: During the Explore phase, the attacker uses:\n- If possible, determine how the secret was selected. If the secret was determined algorithmically (such as by a random number generator) the algorithm may have patterns or dependencies that reduce the size of the secret space. If the secret was created by a human, behavioral factors may, if not completely reduce the space, make some types of secrets more likely than others. (For example, humans may use the same secrets in multiple places or use secrets that look or sound familiar for ease of recall.)\n- If the secret was chosen algorithmically, cryptanalysis can be applied to the algorithm to discover patterns in this algorithm. (This is true even if the secret is not used in cryptography.) Periodicity, the need for seed values, or weaknesses in the generator all can result in a significantly smaller secret space.\n- If the secret was chosen by a person, social engineering and simple espionage can indicate patterns in their secret selection. If old secrets can be learned (and a target may feel they have little need to protect a secret that has been replaced) hints as to their selection preferences can be gleaned. These can include character substitutions a target employs, patterns in sources (dates, famous phrases, music lyrics, family members, etc.). Once these patterns have been determined, the initial efforts of a brute-force attack can focus on these areas.\n- Some algorithmic techniques for secret selection may leave indicators that can be tested for relatively easily and which could then be used to eliminate large areas of the search space for consideration. For example, it may be possible to determine that a secret does or does not start with a given character after a relatively small number of tests. Alternatively, it might be possible to discover the length of the secret relatively easily. These discoveries would significantly reduce the search space, thus increasing speed with which the attacker discovers the secret.\nDescription: [Reduce search space] Find ways to reduce the secret space. The smaller the attacker can make the space they need to search for the secret value, the greater their chances for success. There are a great many ways in which the search space may be reduced.\nStep 3: During the Explore phase, the attacker uses:\n- (no specific techniques listed)\nDescription: [Expand victory conditions] It is sometimes possible to expand victory conditions. For example, the attacker might not need to know the exact secret but simply needs a value that produces the same result using a one-way function. While doing this does not reduce the size of the search space, the presence of multiple victory conditions does reduce the likely amount of time that the attacker will need to explore the space before finding a workable value.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- (no specific techniques listed)\nDescription: [Gather information so attack can be performed independently.] If possible, gather the necessary information so a successful search can be determined without consultation of an external authority. This can be accomplished by capturing cryptotext (if the goal is decoding the text) or the encrypted password dictionary (if the goal is learning passwords)..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The attacker must be able to determine when they have successfully guessed the secret. As such, one-time pads are immune to this type of attack since there is no way to determine when a guess is correct. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Low: The attack simply requires basic scripting ability to automate the exploration of the search space. More sophisticated attackers may be able to use more advanced methods to reduce the search space and increase the speed with which the secret is located. \nResources:\n- None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack. Ultimately, the speed with which an attacker discovers a secret is directly proportional to the computational resources the attacker has at their disposal. This attack method is resource expensive: having large amounts of computational power do not guarantee timely success, but having only minimal resources makes the problem intractable against all but the weakest secret selection procedures."}

Using those responses, they attempt to guess the actual operating system.\n- Induce errors to find informative error messages\nDescription: [Fingerprinting of the operating system] In order to perform a valid path traversal, the adversary needs to know what the underlying OS is so that the proper file seperator is used.\nStep 2: During the Explore phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links on a web page. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL.\n- Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of a web application. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL. Manual traversal of this type is frequently necessary to identify forms that are GET method forms rather than POST forms.\n- Use a browser to manually explore a website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browser plug-ins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the URL discovery.\nDescription: [Survey application] Using manual or automated means, an adversary will survey the target application looking for all areas where user input is taken to specify a file name or path.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Provide \"../\" or \"..\\\" at the beginning of any filename to traverse to the parent directory\n- Use a list of probe strings as path traversal payload.

Strings contain relative path sequences such as \"../\".\n- Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of relative path traversal probes in known URLs.\nDescription: [Attempt variations on input parameters] Using manual or automated means, an adversary attempts varying relative file path combinations on all found user input locations and observes the responses.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Manipulate file and its path by injecting relative path sequences (e.g. \"../\").\n- Download files, modify files, or try to execute shell commands (with binary files).\nDescription: [Access, modify, or execute arbitrary files.] An adversary injects path traversal syntax into identified vulnerable inputs to cause inappropriate reading, writing or execution of files. An adversary could be able to read directories or files which they are normally not allowed to read. The adversary could also access data outside the web document root, or include scripts, source code and other kinds of files from external websites.

Slow the response of the real DNS server by causing Denial-of-service. This gives adversaries enough time to guess transaction\n- Adversary crafts DNS response with the same transaction ID as in the request. The adversary sends out DNS responses before the authorized DNS server. This forces DNS local cache stores fake DNS response (wrong answer). The fake DNS responses usually include a malicious website's IP address.\nDescription: [Attempt sending crafted records to DNS cache] A request is sent to the authoritative server for target website and wait for the iterative name resolver. An adversary sends bogus request to the DNS local server, and then floods responses that trick a DNS cache to remember malicious responses, which are wrong answers of DNS query.\nStep 3: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Redirecting Web traffic to a site that looks enough like the original so as to not raise any suspicion.\n- Adversary-in-the-Middle (CAPEC-94) intercepts secure communication between two parties.\nDescription: [Redirect users to malicious website] As the adversary succeeds in exploiting the vulnerability, the victim connects to a malicious site using a good web site's domain name..\nKey prerequisites:\n- A DNS cache must be vulnerable to some attack that allows the adversary to replace addresses in its lookup table.Client applications must trust the corrupted cashed values and utilize them for their domain name resolutions. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Medium: To overwrite/modify targeted DNS cache \nResources:\n- The adversary must have the resources to modify the targeted cache. In addition, in most cases the adversary will wish to host the sites to which users will be redirected, although in some cases redirecting to a third party site will accomplish the adversary's goals."}

Both the sender and recipient are able to compute the checksum based on the contents of the message. If the message contents change between the sender and recipient, the sender and recipient will compute different checksum values. Since the sender's checksum value is transmitted with the message, the recipient would know that a modification occurred. In checksum spoofing an adversary modifies the message body and then modifies the corresponding checksum so that the recipient's checksum calculation will match the checksum (created by the adversary) in the message.

The term content spoofing is most often used to describe modification of web pages hosted by a target to display the adversary's content instead of the owner's content. However, any content can be spoofed, including the content of email messages, file transfers, or the content of other network communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a message between the sender and recipient). Usually, the adversary will attempt to hide the fact that the content has been modified, but in some cases, such as with web site defacement, this is not necessary. Content Spoofing can lead to malware exposure, financial fraud (if the content governs financial transactions), privacy violations, and other unwanted outcomes.It is a Meta-level pattern (Stable) with Medium severity and a Medium likelihood."}

Spear Phishing is an enhanced version of the Phishing attack targeted to a specific user or group. The quality of the targeted email is usually enhanced by appearing to come from a known or trusted entity. If the email account of some trusted entity has been compromised the message may be digitally signed. The message will contain information specific to the targeted users that will enhance the probability that they will follow the URL to the compromised site. For example, the message may indicate knowledge of the targets employment, residence, interests, or other information that suggests familiarity. As soon as the user follows the instructions in the message, the attack proceeds as a standard Phishing attack.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with High severity and a High likelihood."}

See also: CAPEC-118.\n- Identify trusted associates, colleagues and friends of target. See also: CAPEC-118.\n- Utilize social engineering attack patterns such as Pretexting. See also: CAPEC-407.\n- Collect social information via dumpster diving. See also: CAPEC-406.\n- Collect social information via traditional sources. See also: CAPEC-118.\n- Collect social information via Non-traditional sources. See also: CAPEC-118.\nDescription: [Obtain useful contextual detailed information about the targeted user or organization] An adversary collects useful contextual detailed information about the targeted user or organization in order to craft a more deceptive and enticing message to lure the target into responding.\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Optionally obtain a domain name that visually looks similar to the legitimate site's domain name. An example is www.paypaI.com vs. www.paypal.com (the first one contains a capital i, instead of a lower case L).\n- Optionally obtain a legitimate SSL certificate for the new domain name.\nDescription: [Optional: Obtain domain name and certificate to spoof legitimate site] This optional step can be used to help the adversary impersonate the legitimate site more convincingly. The adversary can use homograph attacks to convince users that they are using the legitimate website. Note that this step is not required for phishing attacks, and many phishing attacks simply supply URLs containing an IP address and no SSL certificate.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use spidering software to get copy of web pages on legitimate site.\n- Manually save copies of required web pages from legitimate site.\n- Create new web pages that have the legitimate site's look at feel, but contain completely new content.\nDescription: [Optional: Explore legitimate website and create duplicate] An adversary creates a website (optionally at a URL that looks similar to the original URL) that closely resembles the website that they are trying to impersonate. That website will typically have a login form for the victim to put in their authentication credentials. There can be different variations on a theme here.\nStep 4: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Integrate localized information in the web pages created to duplicate the original website. Those localized information could be dynamically generated based on unique key or IP address of the future victim.\nDescription: [Optional: Build variants of the website with very specific user information e.g., living area, etc.] Once the adversary has their website which duplicates a legitimate website, they need to build very custom user related information in it. For example, they could create multiple variants of the website which would target different living area users by providing information such as local news, local weather, etc. so that the user believes this is a new feature from the website.\nStep 5: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Send the user a message from a spoofed legitimate-looking e-mail address that asks the user to click on the included link.\n- Place phishing link in post to online forum.\nDescription: [Convince user to enter sensitive information on adversary's site.] An adversary sends a message (typically an e-mail) to the victim that has some sort of a call to action to get the user to click on the link included in the e-mail (which takes the victim to adversary's website) and log in. The key is to get the victim to believe that the message is coming from a legitimate entity trusted by the victim or with which the victim or does business and that the website pointed to by the URL in the e-mail is the legitimate website. A call to action will usually need to sound legitimate and urgent enough to prompt action from the user.\nStep 6: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Log in to the legitimate site using another user's supplied credentials.\nDescription: [Use stolen credentials to log into legitimate site] Once the adversary captures some sensitive information through phishing (login credentials, credit card information, etc.) the adversary can leverage this information. For instance, the adversary can use the victim's login credentials to log into their bank account and transfer money to an account of their choice..\nKey prerequisites:\n- None. Any user can be targeted by a Spear Phishing attack. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Medium: Spear phishing attacks require specific knowledge of the victims being targeted, such as which bank is being used by the victims, or websites they commonly log into (Google, Facebook, etc). \nResources:\n- An adversay must have the ability communicate their phishing scheme to the victims (via email, instance message, etc.), as well as a website or other platform for victims to enter personal information into."}

Normal Microsoft utilities do not show the presence of an ADS stream attached to a file. The additional space for the ADS is not recorded in the displayed file size. The additional space for ADS is accounted for in the used space on the volume. An ADS can be any type of file. ADS are copied by standard Microsoft utilities between NTFS volumes. ADS can be used by an attacker or intruder to hide tools, scripts, and data from detection by normal system utilities. Many anti-virus programs do not check for or scan ADS.

Many browsers' plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the discovery.\nDescription: [Survey the application for user-controllable inputs] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary records all entry points for inputs that happen to be reflected in a client-side non-script element. These non-script elements can be located in the HTML content (head, body, comments), in an HTML tag, XML, CSS, etc.\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Manually inject various script payloads into each identified entry point using a list of common script injection probes that typically work in a client-side non-script elements context and observe system behavior to determine if script was executed. Since these probes may have to be injected in many different types of non-script elements, they should cover a variety of possible contexts (CSS, HTML tag, XML, etc.).\n- Use an automated injection attack tool to inject various script payloads into each identified entry point using a list of common script injection probes that typically work in a client-side non-script elements context and observe system behavior to determine if script was executed.

This will alert the adversary when the victim has accessed the content and will give the adversary control over the victim's browser, allowing them access to cookies, user screenshot, user clipboard, and more complex XSS attacks.\nDescription: [Create malicious XSS content] Once the adversary has determined which entry points are vulnerable to XSS, they will interact with the web application to store the malicious content. Because of the nature of this attack, it is mostly carried out through stored XSS, although it is possible to perform this attack using reflected XSS. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from a victim.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Send a phishing email to the victim containing a URL that will direct them to the malicious stored content.\n- Simply wait for a victim to view the content. This is viable in situations where content is posted to a popular public forum.\nDescription: [Get victim to view stored content] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to view the stored malicious content on the webpage..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The target client software must allow the execution of scripts generated by remote hosts. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Low: To achieve a redirection and use of less trusted source, an adversary can simply edit content such as XML payload or HTML files that are sent to client machine.\n- High: Exploiting a client side vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the browser's executable process. \nResources:\n- Ability to include malicious script in document, e.g. HTML file, or XML document. Ability to deploy a custom hostile service for access by targeted clients. Ability to communicate synchronously or asynchronously with client machine"}

For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the \"script\" tag using the alternate forms of \"Script\" or \"ScRiPt\" may bypass filters where \"script\" is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine. The attack can result in the execution of otherwise prohibited functionality.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with High severity and a High likelihood."}

Many applications utilize registries to store configuration and service information.

The adversary tricks the victim into accessing a URL that responds with the script file. Some browsers will detect that the specified MIME type of the file does not match the actual type of its content and will automatically switch to using an interpreter for the real content type. If the browser does not invoke script filters before doing this, the adversary's script may run on the target unsanitized, possibly revealing the victim's cookies or executing arbitrary script in their browser.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with Medium severity and a  likelihood."}

You work in a SOC protecting data for enterprise customers helping to protect their digital assets.", "input": "Summarize how XSS Using MIME Type Mismatch (CAPEC-209) is executed and what conditions enable it.", "output": "Execution flow: \nStep 1: During the Explore phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links and analyze the web pages to file upload features\n- Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application.\n- Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browsers' plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the discovery.\nDescription: [Survey the application for stored user-controllable inputs] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links and actions on a web site. They record all areas that allow a user to upload content through an HTTP POST request. This is typically found in blogs or forums.\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Upload a script file with a MIME type of text/plain to a forum and then access the uploaded file to see if the script is executed. If possible, the script displays a unique identifier so the adversary knows for certain it was executed when testing.\nDescription: [Probe identified potential entry points for MIME type mismatch] The adversary uses the entry points gathered in the \"Explore\" phase as a target list and uploads files with scripting content, but whose MIME type is specified as a file type that cannot execute scripting content. If the application only checks the MIME type of the file, it may let the file through, causing the script to be executed by any user who accesses the file.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use a tool such as BeEF to store a hook into the web application. This will alert the adversary when the victim has accessed the content and will give the adversary control over the victim's browser, allowing them access to cookies, user screenshot, user clipboard, and more complex XSS attacks.\nDescription: [Store malicious XSS content] Once the adversary has determined which file upload locations are vulnerable to MIME type mismatch, they will upload a malicious script disguised as a non scripting file. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from a victim.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Send a phishing email to the victim containing a URL that will direct them to the malicious stored content.\n- Simply wait for a victim to view the content. This is viable in situations where content is posted to a popular public forum.\nDescription: [Get victim to view stored content] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to view the stored malicious content on the webpage..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The victim must follow a crafted link that references a scripting file that is mis-typed as a non-executable file.\n- The victim's browser must detect the true type of a mis-labeled scripting file and invoke the appropriate script interpreter without first performing filtering on the content. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- None \nResources:\n- The adversary must have the ability to source the file of the incorrect MIME type containing a script."}

Parameters like length, composition, and how many variations to try are important to get the most cost-effective impact from the fuzzer.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- (no specific techniques listed)\nDescription: [Observe the outcome] Observe the outputs to the inputs fed into the system by fuzzers and see if there are any log or error messages that might provide information to map the application\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Modify the parameters in the fuzzing tool according to the observed error messages. Repeat with enough parameters until the application has been sufficiently mapped.\n- If the application rejects the large amount of fuzzing messages from the same host machine, the adversary needs to hide the attacks by changing the IP addresses or other credentials.\nDescription: [Craft exploit payloads] An adversary usually needs to modify the fuzzing parameters according to the observed error messages to get the desired sensitive information for the application. To defeat correlation, the adversary may try changing the origin IP addresses or client browser identification strings or start a new session from where they left off in obfuscating the attack..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The target application must fail to sanitize incoming messages adequately before processing. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Medium: Although fuzzing parameters is not difficult, and often possible with automated fuzzing tools, interpreting the error conditions and modifying the parameters so as to move further in the process of mapping the application requires detailed knowledge of target platform, the languages and packages used as well as software design. \nResources:\n- Fuzzing tools, which automatically generate and send message variants, are necessary for this attack. The attacker must have sufficient access to send messages to the target. The attacker must also have the ability to observe the target application's log and/or error messages in order to collect information about the target."}

However, the web server cannot assume that the requests it receives have been subject to those validations, because an attacker can use an alternate method for crafting the HTTP Request and submit data that contains poisoned values designed to spoof a user and/or get the web server to disclose information.\n- Web 2.0 style applications may be particularly vulnerable because they in large part rely on existing infrastructure which provides scalability without the ability to govern the clients. Attackers identify vulnerabilities that either assume the client side is responsible for some security services (without the requisite ability to ensure enforcement of these checks) and/or the lack of a hardened, default deny server configuration that allows for an attacker probing for weaknesses in unexpected ways.

This can be done manually or a dynamic tool (black box) can be used to automate this. An attacker can also use a custom script for that purpose.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Boron tagging. Choose clear attack inputs that are easy to notice in output. In binary this is often 0xa5a5a5a5 (alternating 1s and 0s). Another obvious tag value is all zeroes, but it is not always obvious what goes wrong if the null values get into the data.\n- Check Log files. An attacker with access to log files can look at the outcome of bad input.\nDescription: [Monitor responses] Watch for any indication of failure occurring. Carefully watch to see what happened when filter failure occurred. Did the data get in?\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- DoS through filter failure. The attacker causes the system to crash or stay down because of its failure to filter properly.\n- Malicious code execution.

Sometimes very large transactions can be used to destroy a log file or cause partial logging failures. In this kind of attack, log processing code might be examining a transaction in real-time processing, but the oversized transaction causes a logic branch or an exception of some kind that is trapped. In other words, the transaction is still executed, but the logging or filtering mechanism still fails. This has two consequences, the first being that you can run transactions that are not logged in any way (or perhaps the log entry is completely corrupted). The second consequence is that you might slip through an active filter that otherwise would stop your attack."}

Leveraging a buffer overflow the attacker makes the filter fail insecurely and the tainted data is permitted to enter unfiltered into the system, subsequently causing a SQL injection.\n- Audit Truncation and Filters with Buffer Overflow. Sometimes very large transactions can be used to destroy a log file or cause partial logging failures. In this kind of attack, log processing code might be examining a transaction in real-time processing, but the oversized transaction causes a logic branch or an exception of some kind that is trapped. In other words, the transaction is still executed, but the logging or filtering mechanism still fails. This has two consequences, the first being that you can run transactions that are not logged in any way (or perhaps the log entry is completely corrupted). The second consequence is that you might slip through an active filter that otherwise would stop your attack.. \nRelated weaknesses: CWE-120, CWE-119, CWE-118, CWE-74, CWE-20, CWE-680, CWE-733, CWE-697."}

Filters may not scan beyond invalid characters but during later stages of processing content that follows these invalid characters may still be processed. This allows the adversary to sneak prohibited commands past filters and perform normally prohibited operations. Invalid characters may include null, carriage return, line feed or tab in an identifier. Successful bypassing of the filter can result in a XSS attack, resulting in the disclosure of web cookies or possibly other results.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with Medium severity and a  likelihood."}

Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL.\n- Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application.\n- Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browsers' plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the discovery.\nDescription: [Survey the application for user-controllable inputs] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links and actions on a web site. They record all the links, the forms, the resources accessed and all other potential entry-points for the web application.\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use a list of XSS probe strings preceded by an invalid character(s) such as null, carriage return, line feed, or tab to inject script in parameters of known URLs. If possible, the probe strings contain a unique identifier.\n- Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of XSS probes in known URLs.\n- Use a list of HTML special characters preceded by an invalid character(s) to inject into parameters of known URLs and check if they were properly encoded, replaced, or filtered out.\nDescription: [Probe identified potential entry points for XSS vulnerabilities using invalid characters] The adversary uses the entry points gathered in the \"Explore\" phase as a target list and injects various common script payloads and special characters preceded by an invalid character(s) to determine if an entry point actually represents a vulnerability and to characterize the extent to which the vulnerability can be exploited. The adversary is looking for cases where an invalid character causes an input filter to stop processing, allowing the malicious input that follows to bypass the filter\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Change a URL parameter to include a malicious script tag preceded by invalid character(s).\n- Send information gathered from the malicious script to a remote endpoint.\nDescription: [Craft malicious XSS URL] Once the adversary has determined which parameters are vulnerable to XSS, they will craft a malicious URL containing the XSS exploit. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from the victim.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Send a phishing email to the victim containing the malicious URL. This can be hidden in a hyperlink as to not show the full URL, which might draw suspicion.\n- Put the malicious URL on a public forum, where many victims might accidentally click the link.\nDescription: [Get victim to click URL] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to access the malicious URL..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The target must fail to remove invalid characters from input and fail to adequately scan beyond these characters. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- None \nResources:\n- None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack."}

Manual traversal of this type is frequently necessary to identify forms that are GET method forms rather than POST forms.\n- Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browser's plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the URL discovery.\nDescription: [Survey application] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links on a web site. They record all the links they find. The adversary is looking for URLs that show PHP file inclusion is used, which can look something like \"http://vulnerable-website/file.php?file=index.php\".\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Use a list of probe strings to inject in parameters of known URLs. The probe strings are variants of path traversal techniques used to include well known files.\n- Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of local file inclusion probes in known URLs.\nDescription: [Attempt variations on input parameters] Once the adversary finds a vulnerable URL that takes file input, they attempt a variety of path traversal techniques to attempt to get the application to display the contents of a local file, or execute a different PHP file already stored locally on the server.\nStep 3: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- (no specific techniques listed)\nDescription: [Include desired local file] Once the adversary has determined which techniques of path traversal successfully work with the vulnerable PHP application, they will target a specific local file to include. These can be files such as \"/etc/passwd\", \"/etc/shadow\", or configuration files for the application that might expose sensitive information..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The targeted PHP application must have a bug that allows an attacker to control which code file is loaded at some juncture. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- None \nResources:\n- The attacker needs to have enough access to the target application to control the identity of a locally included PHP file."}

If this causes a crash or some unintended behavior, it is likely that this is a valid injection vector.\nDescription: [Find injection vector] The adversary identifies an injection vector to deliver the excessive content to the targeted application's buffer.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Create malicious shellcode that will execute when the program execution is returned to it.\n- Use a NOP-sled in the overflow content to more easily \"slide\" into the malicious code. This is done so that the exact return address need not be correct, only in the range of all of the NOPs\n- The adversary will choose a SOAP type that allows them to put shellcode into the buffer when the array is read into the application.\nDescription: [Craft overflow content] The adversary crafts the content to be injected. If the intent is to simply cause the software to crash, the content need only consist of an excessive quantity of random data.

Using a network sniffer such as wireshark, the adversary observes communications into and out of the target system.\n- Monitor API execution. Using a tool such as ktrace, strace, APISpy, or another debugging tool, the adversary observes the system calls and API calls that are made by the target system, and the nature of their parameters.\n- Observe inputs using web inspection tools (OWASP's WebScarab, Paros, TamperData, TamperIE, etc.)\nDescription: [Observe communication and inputs] The fuzzing adversary observes the target system looking for inputs and communications between modules, subsystems, or systems.\nStep 2: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Boundary cases. Generate fuzz inputs that attack boundary cases of protocol fields, inputs, or other communications limits. Examples include 0xff and 0x00 for single-byte inputs. In binary situations, approach each bit of an individual field with on and off (e.g., 0x80).\n- Attempt arguments to system calls or APIs. The variations include payloads that, if they were successful, could lead to a compromise on the system.\nDescription: [Generate fuzzed inputs] Given a fuzzing tool, a target input or protocol, and limits on time, complexity, and input variety, generate a list of inputs to try. Although fuzzing is random, it is not exhaustive. Parameters like length, composition, and how many variations to try are important to get the most cost-effective impact from the fuzzer.\nStep 3: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- (no specific techniques listed)\nDescription: [Observe the outcome] Observe the outputs to the inputs fed into the system by fuzzers and see if there are any log or error messages that either provide user/sensitive data or give information about an expected template that could be used to produce this data.\nStep 4: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Create variants of expected templates that request additional information\n- Create variants that exclude limiting clauses\n- Create variants that alter fields taht identify the requester in order to subvert access controls\n- Repeat different fuzzing variants until sensitive information is divulged\nDescription: [Craft exploit payloads] If the logs did not reveal any user/sensitive data, an adversary will attempt to make the fuzzing inputs form to an expected template.\nKey prerequisites:\n- The server must assume that the queries it receives follow specific templates and/or have fields or attributes that follow specific procedures. The server must process queries that it receives without adequately checking or sanitizing queries to ensure they follow these templates. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- None \nResources:\n- The attacker must have sufficient privileges to send queries to the targeted server. A normal client might limit the nature of these queries, so the attacker must either have a modified client or their own application which allows them to modify the expected queries."}

If the application detects the corruption but fails in an unsafe way, this attack could result in the continuation of services but without certain security structures, such as filters or access controls. For example, if the corrupted file configures filters, an unsafe response from an application could result in simply disabling the filtering mechanisms due to the lack of usable configuration data. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- None \nResources:\n- This varies depending on the resources necessary to corrupt the configuration file and the resources needed to force the application to re-read it (if any)."}

Tracerouting can allow the adversary to construct a working topology of systems and routers by listing the systems through which data passes through on their way to the targeted machine. This attack can return varied results depending upon the type of traceroute that is performed. Traceroute works by sending packets to a target while incrementing the Time-to-Live field in the packet header. As the packet traverses each hop along its way to the destination, its TTL expires generating an ICMP diagnostic message that identifies where the packet expired.

So by sending an ACK segment to a port, the adversary can identify that the host is alive by looking for a RST packet. Typically, a remote server will respond with a RST regardless of whether a port is open or closed. In this way, TCP ACK pings cannot discover the state of a remote port because the behavior is the same in either case. The firewall will look up the ACK packet in its state-table and discard the segment because it does not correspond to any active connection.

UDP pings are useful because some firewalls are not configured to block UDP datagrams sent to strange or typically unused ports, like ports in the 65K range.

The configuration files are frequently stored in predictable locations, so an attacker that can fingerprint a server process such as a web server or database server can quickly identify the likely locale where the configuration is stored. And this is of course not limited to server processes. Unix shells rely on profile files to store environment variables, search paths for programs and so on. If the aliases are changed, then a standard Unix \"cp\" command can be rerouted to \"rm\" or other standard command so the user's intention is subverted.\n- The attack can be directed at a client system, such as causing buffer overrun through loading seemingly benign image files, as in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028 where specially crafted JPEG files could cause a buffer overrun once loaded into the browser.. \nRelated weaknesses: CWE-94, CWE-96, CWE-95, CWE-97, CWE-272, CWE-59, CWE-282, CWE-270."}

In some cases, services will respond to poorly formed calls with valid ones.\nDescription: [Identify all interfaces] Determine the exposed interfaces by querying the registry as well as probably sniffing to expose interfaces that are not explicitly listed.\nStep 4: During the Experiment phase, the attacker uses:\n- Manually attempt calls to the service using an educated guess approach, including the use of terms like' 'test', 'debug', 'delete', etc.\n- Use automated tools to scan the service to attempt to reverse engineer exposed, but undocumented, features.\nDescription: [Attempt to discover unpublished functions] Using manual or automated means, discover unpublished or undocumented functions exposed by the service.\nStep 5: During the Exploit phase, the attacker uses:\n- Execute features that are not intended to be used by general system users.\n- Craft malicious calls to features not intended to be used by general system users that take advantage of security flaws found in the functions.\nDescription: [Exploit unpublished functions] Using information determined via experimentation, exploit the unpublished features of the service..\nKey prerequisites:\n- The architecture under attack must publish or otherwise make available services that clients can attach to, either in an unauthenticated fashion, or having obtained an authentication token elsewhere. The service need not be 'discoverable', but in the event it isn't it must have some way of being discovered by an attacker. This might include listening on a well-known port. Ultimately, the likelihood of exploit depends on discoverability of the vulnerable service. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Low: A number of web service digging tools are available for free that help discover exposed web services and their interfaces. In the event that a web service is not listed, the attacker does not need to know much more in addition to the format of web service messages that they can sniff/monitor for. \nResources:\n- None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack.

The attacker applies methods to decode such encodings and compressions as Base64, unzip, unrar, RLE decoding, gzip decompression and so on.\n- Common data typing. The attacker looks for common file signatures for well-known file types (JPEG, TIFF, ASN.1, LDIF, etc.). If the signatures match, they attempt decoding in that format.\nDescription: [Retrieve Embedded Data] The attacker then uses a variety of techniques, such as sniffing, reverse-engineering, and cryptanalysis to retrieve the information of interest..\nKey prerequisites:\n- In order to feasibly execute this type of attack, some valuable data must be present in client software.\n- Additionally, this information must be unprotected, or protected in a flawed fashion, or through a mechanism that fails to resist reverse engineering, statistical, or other attack. \nAttacker requirements: \nSkills:\n- Medium: The attacker must possess knowledge of client code structure as well as ability to reverse-engineer or decompile it or probe it in other ways.

Such access, for this set of attacks, will likely be physical. The attacker will make use of reverse engineering technologies, perhaps for data or to extract functionality from the binary. Such tool use may be as simple as \"Strings\" or a hex editor. Removing functionality may require the use of only a hex editor, or may require aspects of the toolchain used to construct the application: for instance the Adobe Flash development environment.

Lock Bumping is the use of a special type of key that can be tapped or bumped to cause the pins within the lock to fall into temporary alignment, allowing the lock to be opened. Lock bumping allows an attacker to open a lock without having the correct key. A standard lock is secured by a set of internal pins that prevent the device from turning. Spring loaded driver pins push down on the key pins. When the correct key is inserted, the ridges on the key push the key pins up and against the driver pins, causing correct alignment which allows the lock cylinder to rotate. A bump key is a specially constructed key that exploits this design. When the bump key is struck or firmly tapped, its teeth transfer the force of the tap into the key pins, causing the lock to momentarily shift into proper alignment for the mechanism to be opened.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with  severity and a  likelihood."}

Most magstripe card data formats conform to ISO standards 7810, 7811, 7813, 8583, and 4909. The primary advantage of magstripe technology is ease of encoding and portability, but this also renders magnetic strip cards susceptible to unauthorized duplication. If magstripe cards are used for access control, all an attacker need do is obtain a valid card long enough to make a copy of the card and then return the card to its location (i.e. a co-worker's desk). Magstripe reader/writers are widely available as well as software for analyzing data encoded on the cards. By swiping a valid card, it becomes trivial to make any number of duplicates that function as the original.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with  severity and a  likelihood."}

ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping). Once the drive is installed into the new system the BIOS can be used to reset the drive password.It is a Detailed-level pattern (Draft) with  severity and a  likelihood."}
